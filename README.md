# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Rate Monitoring using PPG

## üìå Problem Statement
Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and continuous monitoring of heart rate is crucial for early detection of abnormalities. Traditional heart rate measurement methods are often bulky, expensive, or inconvenient for everyday use. There is a need for a simple, low-cost, and non-invasive technique to monitor heart rate in real time.

## üìñ Project Description
This project implements a heart rate monitoring system using the Photoplethysmography (PPG) technique. PPG is an optical method that measures blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue using a light source and a photodetector.  

The hardware consists of a PPG sensor module, a microcontroller, and a display unit. The sensor detects variations in light absorption corresponding to the heartbeat, and the microcontroller processes the signal to calculate the heart rate in beats per minute (BPM). The processed data can be displayed on an LCD screen or transmitted for further analysis.  

This system provides a portable, low-cost, and reliable way to measure heart rate, making it useful for personal healthcare, fitness tracking, and medical monitoring applications.
