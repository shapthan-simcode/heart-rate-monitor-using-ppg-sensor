## ðŸ“– Project Description
This project is a hardware-based system developed using electronic components such as sensors, microcontrollers, and actuators. It is designed to [briefly describe what it does]. The system works by detecting input from the environment through sensors, processing the data using a controller, and providing the required output.  

The project demonstrates practical applications of electronics in solving real-life problems and can be extended for larger-scale implementations.
